When another student reviewed my code I received a few tips from them to improve my code:
* There were some occasions where I put the hints for the EditTexts in the onCreate, it is better to put these hints in the xml
  layout file, so I did that.
* Toasts and other functions still had hardcoded strings in them, it is better to put these strings in the strings.xml file and 
  then use these strings in the activities and classes. I have also done this now.
* I had also written classes that weren't in a seperate file with a lower case letter as first letter. These classes always need 
  to start with an upper case letter. This has also been fixed. 
* There were some methods that were really short and self explainatory that had comments. This is not necessary, so they have
  been removed.
